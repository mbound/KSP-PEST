## Parts in this mod:

Pods:

SP-X1- Spherical probe core with attachments on both ends, making it useful inside stacks. A little more versatile.

GENSYS - Probe core based off of the Dawn spacecraft. Hollow inside, allows you to store fuel or engines. Is equipped with full SAS, 20 units of monopropellant, and a 200 unit battery.

Utility:

Probe Shock Absorber - Based on the Venera probes, it's a heavy part that can help ensure your probe lands right side up. It also kind of helps with aerobraking.

Science:

Coiled Antenna - Long range, low energy antenna for spacecraft. Pretty simple, has attachment nodes on top and bottom.

Gas Chromatographer - A small device that analyzes the chemical makeup of an atmosphere.
